The Zagat Guide was created by Tim and Nina Zagat in 1979. Eating out was a hobby of theirs, and they started rating the different restaurants they visited.  They eventually created a ballot, which they shared with friends.  The various ballots were tallied and scored, using a 3 to 1 scale for Food, Decor, and Service.
